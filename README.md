The Project
------------
The project was developed as part of a partnership with CleanLed Company to develop an entertainemnt system for a variaty of events.
Due to an increasing demand to take pictures at the enterance of events, i developed a software that integrated with an array of LED Screens to allow using an android based client and a JavaFX Based server to select the background they wish to take a picture with and also leave a comment that will appear in a cyclic manner with other comments.
Also, when idle, the system knows how to play a video for entertainment.

Tested Event
------------
The system was tested succesfully in BatMiztva event and was highly praised.
Due to backlight issues that were difficult to solve when taking pictures, rendering the participets dark, we abandoned the project for the time being.
